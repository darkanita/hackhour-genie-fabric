    "1. Select **Genie** from the sidebar navigation. (It is recommended to right-click and select Open Link in New Window or Tab)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click the **+ New** button at top right.\n",

    "5. If it was not satisfactory, chances are Genie did not deduce that the values of the **province** field are the standard abbreviations for Canadian provinces. These abbreviations were in the training set for Genie's Large Language Model (LLM), but it just doesn't have enough context on our data to know to use them here. Give it some context by entering this into the chat window:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use Canadian province abbreviations for the province field\n",
    "```\n",
    "6. Did Genie respond appropriately to this guidance? Again, click the **`(✓)Yes`** icon if yes, otherwise click the **`(x)Fix it`** icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. If Genie told you that the data in the table uses province names rather than abbreviations, simply tell it that it is incorrect:\n",
    "```\n",
    "no it doesn't, the data in the province field is abbreviations\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  How does Genie respond to the new information? If Genie made an error previously, scroll back in the dialogue to see that Genie has updated its previous response.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Let's try a new query that also depends on Genie's contextual understanding of the **province** field:\n",
    "```\n",
    "now do the same for alberta\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "  In order to respond to this query correctly, Genie will have to know that AB in the table represents Alberta. How did Genie do?\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If Genie erred in this dialogue for you, scroll back to where you corrected it and click the **Add as instruction** button. Only users with CAN MANAGE or CAN EDIT privilege on the dashboard can do so; right now that is only you.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Now ask Genie for a visualization: \n",
    "```\n",
    "Show me the distribution of opportunities by sales phase\n",
    "```\n",
    "What type of graph did Genie choose?\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Ask explicitly for a bar chart.\n",
    "```\n",
    "give me a stacked bar chart showing that on a weekly basis\n",
    "```\n",
    "Did Genie figure out the temporal interval correctly?\n",
    "\n",
    "12. If your bar chart seems to have extremely thin and widely spaced vertical bars, it is because Genie chose to treat the X axis as covering a range of time rather than a series of per-week values. Click the pencil icon to edit the visualization; click on the **week** field, and change the scale type from continuous to categorical. Does the graph improve?\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Databricks is constantly improving the underlying large language model that Genie uses to develop responses, so it's possible that you won't receive any errors in your conversation with Genie based on the above example. Try prompting Genie with different queries to see how it responds. Did it respond as you expected or was there a missunderstanding of your question?"
